Notice above: now there are only two categories, and they have SWITCHED POSITIONS! You will see the same pictures as before, but now sort them into the categories in this way. Press the "e" key for the category on the left, and the "i" key for the category on the right. *n *n * Keep your index fingers on the two keys. *n * A red X will appear after a mistake- fix it by pressing the other key. *n * GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN while making as few mistakes as possible.
