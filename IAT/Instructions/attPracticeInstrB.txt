You will now see the words appear in the middle of the computer screen, one at a time. To sort the words into the two groups, as shown above, put your index fingers on the E and I keys of your computer. When a word belongs to the category on the left, press the E key; when a word belongs to the category on the right, press the I key. If you make a mistake, a red X will appear - fix it by pressing the other key. Please keep your index fingers on the two keys during the task. That is, keep your left index finger on the E key and your right index finger on the I key.
