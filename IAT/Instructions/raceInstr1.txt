In the next set of tasks you will be asked to sort words and pictures into groups. Sometimes you will use two groups, such as GOOD vs. BAD words. Other times there will be four groups such as GOOD vs. BAD words and BLACK faces vs. WHITE faces. These tasks require that you sort the words and pictures as quickly as you can while making as few mistakes as possible.
